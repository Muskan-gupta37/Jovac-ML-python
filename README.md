This repository contains the code for a Diabetes Prediction System built using machine learning techniques. 
The system aims to predict whether a person has diabetes based on various health-related features.
Features : 
 a.Machine Learning Model: Trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset from Kaggle.
 b.Accuracy: Achieves a high level of accuracy using techniques like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
 c.Scalability: Can be easily extended to include more health parameters and advanced machine learning models.
